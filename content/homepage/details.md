### A Memorial Seminar with Igarashi Shihan, Friedl Shihan, Shirakawa Shihan
#### August 29, 30, and 31, 2025

Calgary Aikikai's 40th Anniversary came and went in 2020, and so we're happy to announce that we'll be celebrating the legacy of **Inaba Sensei's** vision with our 45th Anniversary instead! We are beyond excited to welcome eighth-dan [Kazuo Igarashi](https://igarashidojo.jp/english/english.html), seventh-dan [Michael Friedl](https://aikidoofashland.net), and sixth-dan [Ryuji Shirakawa](http://www.shinburenseijuku.com), who have continually nurtured and supported us since our founder's passing, for the first and likely only time. This historic gathering represents a rare opportunity to train with these distinguished instructors in celebration of our dojo's enduring legacy.
