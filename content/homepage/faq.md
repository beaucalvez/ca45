How far airport is from dojo and what would be the best way (and reasonable price) to travel from the airport to city center?
: The airport is fairly close to the city; that said we donâ€™t have train that connects to the city; your best bet will be a ride-share (Uber, Lyft) or taxi for about $40ish, or you could use one of the Airport Shuttles that leave the airport to downtown areas regularly

Can You recommend any hotel near Seminar place?
: We are currently working to get an event hotel in place for the seminar. Once we do we will post a section here to let people know what the deal. The locations we are looking at are all central to the venue and within walking distance.

Is there parking for the event?
: Given that the venue is downtown there is plenty of parking in the area. There is $5 parking on Saturday and Sunday directly adjacent to the Calgary Chinese Cultural Center on the western wall of the building. There is also $1 parking per 12 hours in the Harmony Parkade about two blocks from the venue. Street parking is also plentiful and reasonable on Saturday and free on Sunday.

How about transit to the area?
: Calgary's LRT runs east and west on 7th avenue and services the NE, SW, and SE of the city. It is a 4 block walk from this LRT line to the venue.
